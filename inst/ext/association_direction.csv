Var1,Var2,direction,hypothesis
age,cm_dm,->,older patients likely DM
age,cm_hyp,->,older patients likely hypertension
age,cr,->,older patients likely higher creatinine
age,got,->,older patients likely higher GOT
age,hospital_d,->,older patients likely longer LOS
age,ns1_od,->,older patients likely higher NS1
age,physician_group,->,age determines which physician group
age,plt,->,older patients likely lower platelet
alb,cm_cva,<-,CVA has compromised vascular integrity hence prone to albumin leakage
alb,cr,<-->,platelet and GPT are affected by common variables
alb,wbc,<-->,albumin and WBC are affected by common variables
aptt,got,<-->,APTT and GOT are affected by common variables
aptt,plt,<-->,APTT and platelet are affected by common variables
bil_t,cm_hyp,<-,total bilirubin marks hypertension-related liver damage
bil_t,hospital_d,->,elevated total bilirubin marks worse condition hence longer LOS
bil_t,plt,<-->,total bilirubin and platelet are affected by common variables
bil_t,severe,->,total bilirubin defines severity
bil_t,viral_load,<-,higher viral load likely elevated total bilirubin
cm_crf,got,->,chronic renal failure likely elevated GOT
cm_dm,cm_hyp,->,DM damages endothelium hence hypertension
cm_dm,hospital_d,->,DM worsens condition hence longer LOS
cm_dm,wbc,->,DM makes patients prone to infection hence higher WBC
cm_hbv,ns1_od,->,HBV may also be marked by HBV
cm_hyp,got,->,GOT marks hypertension-related organ damage
cm_hyp,physician_group,<-,physician diagnoses hypertension
cm_hyp,severe,->,hypertension increases severity
cm_hyp,wbc,->,WBC marks hypertension-related inflammation
cr,sex,<-,sex affects creatinine
fever_d,viral_load,<-,viral load affects fever duration
got,gpt,<-->,GOT and GPT are affected by common variables
gpt,plt,<-->,GPT and platelet are affected by common variables
hb,hct,->,higher hemoglobin higher hematocrite
hb,sex,<-,sex affects hemoglobin
hospital_d,ns1_od,<-,higher protein worsens condition hence longer LOS
hospital_d,nst_od,<-,higher antigen worsens condition hence longer LOS
hospital_d,physician_group,<-,physician decides LOS
hospital_d,plt,<-,lower platelet marks worse condition hence longer LOS
hospital_d,severe,<-,severity extends LOS
infection,plt,->,infection type (primary/secondary) affects platelet
infection,viral_load,->,infection type (primary/secondary) affects viral load
ns1_od,nst_od,->,higher protein means higher antigen
physician_group,severe,->,physician determines severity
plt,severe,->,platelet defines severity
plt,viral_load,<-,viral load affects platelet
